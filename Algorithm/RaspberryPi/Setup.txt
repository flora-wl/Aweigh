Things to set up before running latitude.py:

- I2c: 
Inter-intergrated circuit (i2c) is a protocol for communicating with low-speed peripherals.
On the Rpi, you can connect up to two devices to the SCL and SDA master pins (GPIO3 and GPIO5).
Make sure the connections are made in parallel and that each sensor is using a different address.
