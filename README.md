Aweigh is a non-satellite based navigation alternative, inspired by the polarised vision of insects and the mapping of celestial bodies. The project uses the obsolete to reappropriate the contemporary, the subversive to question the ubiquitous, and the natural to navigate the urban world.

This repository enables control of Aweigh's sensor reading and outputs corresponding latitude,longitude. 
It is currently subject to modifications.
